                </h3>
                <p>
                    Men and women aged 18 and over, who are interested in news, or just a weather forecast. People who work / study, plan their day. They are also interested in the news and events of the city. Active citizens.

                    Two personas:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    1. Caring parent/partner
                    2. Successful businessman/women <br><br> I chose these types of personalities, because from time to time each of the people takes their place. We study the weather so that we and our loved ones are warmly dressed and do not get caught in the rain. We want to know the weather so that it cannot ruin our grandiose plans, meetings and affairs. We also want to see what events are suitable for the whole family, or just find out the latest news.

                    5 Listed Scenarios:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    1. I wonder what events are planned in my city this month? <br> 
                    2. Where can the whole family go on the weekend?<br>
                    3. Should I take an umbrella with me today?<br>
                    4. I just want to know the news of this week.<br> 
                    5. What exactly happened in the area where the fire / flood / hurricane happened? Has any help been provided to people?
